  "question": "Why should I get vaccinated?",
  "answer": "The vaccine stimulates your body to create antibodies. These substances help your body fight the virus. What if you come into contact with the virus afterwards? The antibodies will protect you.\r\nThe vaccine not only protects you but also the people around you. Coronavirus is dangerous for people older than 65 or persons that have certain conditions. If over 70% of the population in Belgium is vaccinated, the spread of the virus will be inhibited. This, in turn, will protect the people who cannot have the vaccination. This is known as herd immunity.\r\nVaccination against coronavirus is voluntary and free to all.\r\nYou must continue to comply with the coronavirus rules after vaccination, until sufficient people have been vaccinated. So, maintain a 1.5 metre distance, wear a face mask and wash your hands frequently.",
